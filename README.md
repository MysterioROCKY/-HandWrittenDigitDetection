# Handwritten Digit Detection

Implemented Handwritten Digit Detection: a project utilizing deep learning to accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits.

* Implemented a sequential artificial neural network (ANN) using Keras and TensorFlow.
* Utilized NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for efficient data handling, visualization, and analysis in Python.
* Applied the concept of a confusion matrix to analyze classification results.
